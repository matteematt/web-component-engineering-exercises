# Basic Exercise Template

A basic exercise template usable with modules 1 - 6.

## Instructions

* Download the starter kit.
* View the `index.html` page using a local web server.
    * If using VS Code, try out the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) plugin.
* Work through the exercises using your favorite code editor.
* Have fun!

## Submission

If you wish to submit your exercise solution for review:

* Publish your exercise in a public GitHub repo.
* Email reviews@bluespire.com with the following information:
    * Your Name
    * Optional Twitter tag or other social media handles.
    * The module and exercise you are submitting.
    * A link to the GitHub repo where the exercise is located.
    * A statement indicating that you are ok with your code being video-reviewed and the review being shared with other students and/or on YouTube or other video platforms.

> Submitting an exercise does not guarantee that your solution will be reviewed. Only a small number of student exercises can be reviewed due to limited time and availability. If your submission is selected, you will be notified of the selection as well as when the review is posted.

## Exercise

Build a <ui-pager> custom element for paging through data.
It should have the following attributes:
page-count - The number of data pages to navigate through.
current-page - Tracks the current page.
button-count - Indicates how many page buttons to display before switching to ellipses.
The component should render previous and next buttons, page buttons, and highlight the current page.
The component should raise events when the page has changed.

## Remarks
There are a number of improvements which could be made, but I feel I wouldn't get any extra web components knowledge I feel is worthwhile from completing them
* Better styling
* Improving the page numbers by having one at the start and end and ellipses between gaps
